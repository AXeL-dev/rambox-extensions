# Extensions for Rambox services

Rambox's [Inject JavaScript Code](https://github.com/saenzramiro/rambox/wiki/Inject-JavaScript-Code) feature is very useful - injecting custom JS code allows also inject custom CSS per service which can work as [Stylish](https://userstyles.org/) extensions. Also it can work as simple AdBlock, since you can hide `iframe`s and others elements which show ads. Here I want to collect all my custom JS code which is injected in different messengers.
